Deep Open - attempt to recreate source code of Fishlabs games and their common core Abyss Engine, by revese engineering, for education and entertainment purposes.

Currently the essence of this repo is decompiled, deobfuscated code of [GoF2](/code/GoF2_jsr/) version 1.0.4 (the last update for J2ME published for free by the Fihlabs in 2009). Which can be [compiled and built](./code/build/) back.
